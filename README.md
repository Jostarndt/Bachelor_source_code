# Bachelor_source_code
This is the source code of a reaction-diffusion differential equation, coded in c++ using amandus  ( https://bitbucket.org/guidokanschat/amandus/src/master/ ) and deal.II ( https://www.dealii.org/ )

The important code is hidden in the *.cc files, the physics of the system is defined in the explicit.h, implicit.h, matrix.h.
The outpuut of the compiled program depends dynamically on the parameter files and outputs *.vtk files for a 3D Visualization.
